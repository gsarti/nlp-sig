# NLP SIG meeting 20210503

Present: Carlos, Dafne, Erik, Jesus, Jisk, Joris,  

## History of NLP @ NLeSC

* Reading group started in 2014/2015
* Mailing list started in 2014, biggest contributors: Carlos and Janneke
* SIG started in 2018 (eHumanities), renamed in 2019
* Currently SIG has mailing list, Microsoft Teams page and Github page

## Current NLP Projects (3)

* Erik is working in the project PrZoNa with [Zorginstituut Nederland](zorginstituutnederland.nl) to find texts
about ehealth on [websites with instructions for doctors](https://richtlijnen.nhg.org/). This involves mainly information retrieval.
* Dafne and Jisk are working in the project [Inside the FilterBubble](https://research-software.nl/projects/inside-the-filter-bubble) with the VU.
The project is currently discussing how to automatically extract stances of individuals from text.
* Christiaan and Patrick are working on the project [Understanding visually grounded spoken language via multi-tasking](https://research-software.nl/projects/758)

## Future NLP Projects (8)

* Dafne and Erik are involved in the brainstorm phase for one of the 
[2020 Young Scientist Award projects](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/chris-broekema-and-michele-nuijten-winners-of-the-young-escientist-award-2020/) with UU.
The project aims at automatically detecting statistical errors in academic publications and will start in September 2021.
* There are two new [ASDI projects](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/winning-proposals-asdi-2020-revealed-2/) in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences
* There is one new [ETEC project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/four-pioneering-projects-2020-etec-winners-revealed-2/) related to the field of Humanities (Eye of the Beholder)
* There are four [small-scale Machine Learning projects](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/the-magic-of-machine-learning-2021-call-winners-announced-2/) in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities

## NLP SIG Planning

We discussed actions for increasing the impact of the SIG:

* Invite external speakers, for example from projects
* Coordinate meetings with other groups, like the RSE meetings
* Broaden focus to social sciences
* Invite people from other SIGs, like Machine Learning SIG
* Organize events at conferences, e.g. DHBenelux and CLARIAH

## Stanford course video: the Future of NLP and Deep Learning

Lecture 20 of the Stanford course on Deep Learning and NLP dealt with
[The Future of Deep Learning + NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wWZBGN-iX8)
which discussed among others these possible developments:

* Increased and improved machine learning models, like BERT and ensembles
* Increased and improved language models like GPT-3
* More attention for social impact of NLP models
* More elaborate and challenging machine learning tasks

## Next meeting

The next meeting will be on Monday 31 May 2021 13:00-13:59
