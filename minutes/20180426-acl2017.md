# eHumanities SIG Meeting 26 April 2018

Date: Thursday 26 April 2018, 10:00-11:00. Room: Universal Turing Machine**

## Topic: ACL 2017 Pot Luck

We will discuss papers of the August 2017 meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Vancouver).

Preparation: if you find the time, check the [paper list](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/) of the conference to see if there are any papers that could be interesting for you or your colleagues. Click on the P-id in front of a paper to view its pdf. Do not spend more than two minutes reading a paper. Only try to find out if it could be interesting. If you find a paper worthwile to mention at the meeting, add it to this list.

It is fine to mention papers more than once in this list.

There is also a [list of the 22 best papers](https://acl2017.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/outstanding-and-best-papers-and-the-decision-process/).

You do not need to prepare for this meeting. It is also fine to just attend and listen/discuss.
