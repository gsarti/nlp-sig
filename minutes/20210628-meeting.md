## NLP SIG Planning

We discussed actions for increasing the impact of the SIG:

* Broaden focus to social sciences
  - Not sure about this because some social science work already fits in the Analytics SIG and the Tech Leads might not like this move
* Invite people from other SIGs, like Machine Learning SIG
  - Sounds like good idea for part of the Machine Learning SIG, if we have some focused activity
* Organize focused activity, relevant to people from other SIGs
  - We discussed: NLP of Dutch, project-driven topics and multi-modal machine learning

## Stanford course (2021): Social & Ethical Considerations in NLP Systems

Lecture 19 of the Stanford course on Deep Learning and NLP (2021) dealt with
[Social & Ethical Considerations in NLP Systems](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/slides/cs224n-2021-lecture16-ethics.pdf)
which discussed among others:

* Face recognition and application for IQ guesser and gaydar (accuracy 81/76%)
* Bias in data collected from social media
* Common social bias: confirmation, ingroup, group attribution, halo, just-world
* Micro-agressions: state-of-the-art systems cannot pick it up
* Gender bias in machine translation
* Counter approaches: recognize data bias and social context, use interpretable models
* Challenges: incivility, social bias, privacy violation, misinformation, technology divide

## Next meeting

The next meeting will be on Monday 26 June 2021 13:00-13:59
